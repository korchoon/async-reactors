# Async Reactors

CAUTION: has no documentation nor samples yet.
But I'm already using it in 3 projects.
API is getting better. Soon will add samples based on use-cases.
Now working hard on async/await code debugging: see all async methods running and which stuck on which await.

Some Documentation could be found at /_DOCS/
But I'm really bad in writing. Need to finish API & debugging features first.

## Installation
Add to your unity `manifest.json`:
`"com.hpg.reactors": "https://github.com/korchoon/async-reactors.git#0.1.0"`
